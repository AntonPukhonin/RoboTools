RoboTools
=========

General Info
------------
Collection of utility classes to make android apps development more comfortable, with less code lines and unified across SDK versions.


Status
------
Note, that it is currently in unstable version, so API of some helpers may change and no documentation available at the moment. I plan to release first stable version (1.0) with more documentation up to the end of 2013.
